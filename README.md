A computer code that provide movies of a realistic 3D human point light walker from an arbitrary viewing perspective. The simulation offer many degrees of freedom, such as varying gait styles, body composition, and swing amplitudes of the limbs etc. In addition, self occlusions can be included in the simulation of the point light walker. 
Visual basic, version 5 is used. The exe-file together with the dll-file should work on a PC.
